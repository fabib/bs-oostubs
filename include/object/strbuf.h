 * Stringbuffer implements a buffer gathering characters that have to be 
 * outputed on the screen or a differenct output device. If the buffer is full
 * or the user wishes to print the content of the buffer on the output device
 * method flush() is called. To enable Stringbuffer to work with different 
 * output devices method flush() has to be implemented by the subclasses of 
 * Stringbuffer.
 * Since every subclass needs access to the variables and methods of the
 * Stringbuffer every variable and method of Stringbuffer is declared 
 * 'protected'.
